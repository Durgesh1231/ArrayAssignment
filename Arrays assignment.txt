Ans 1.
If we don’t assign values to array elements and try to access them, the compiler
does not produce an error as in the case of simple variables.Instead, it assigns values that aren’t garbage.
Default value of different data types-:
boolean  false
String   Null
int      0

Ans 2.

In array negative no. cannot pass in array size.

Ans 3.
Heap Area.

Ans 4.
(a).Array size is fixed: The array is static, which means its size is always fixed. The memory which is 
allocated to it cannot be increased or decreased. Below is the program for the same:

(b).Array is homogeneous:The array is homogeneous, i.e., only one type of value can be store in the array. 
For example, if an array type “int“, can only store integer elements and cannot allow the 
elements of other types such as double, float, char so on. Below is the program for the same:

(c). Array is a contiguous blocks of memory.
(d).Insertion and deletion are not easy in Array.

Ans 5.
We can create an array without a name. Such types of nameless arrays are called anonymous arrays.
The main purpose of an anonymous array is just for instant use (just for one-time usage).
An anonymous array is passed as an argument of a method.

example-
new int[] {1,2,3};
new String[]  {"ram","durgesh","akash"};

Ans 6.

(a). using for loop
(b). using for each loop


Ans 7.
array.length: length is a final variable applicable for arrays. With the help of the length 
variable, we can obtain the size of the array. 

string.length() : length() method is a final method which is applicable for string objects. 
The length() method returns the number of characters present in the string. 

The length variable is applicable to an array but not for string objects whereas the length() method 
is applicable for string objects but not for arrays.


public class test {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
             int[] array = new int[4];
             System.out.println("The size of the array is "+ array.length);
                         
             String str = "GeeksforGeeks";
             System.out.println("The size of the String is "+ str.length());
                           
      }
